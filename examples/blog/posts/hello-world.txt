title: Hello World

Welcome to my blog! This is the very first post, built with a static site generator written in **Pluto**.

## What is Pluto?

Pluto is a domain-specific programming language for distributed backend systems. It features:

- Garbage collection
- Dependency injection at the language level
- Typed error handling
- Classes and traits (no inheritance)

## Why a Blog Generator?

Every language needs a "hello world" project. For Pluto, we chose a static blog generator because it exercises file I/O, string processing, and data modeling.

Stay tuned for more posts!
