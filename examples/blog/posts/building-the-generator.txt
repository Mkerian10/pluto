This blog was generated by a static site generator written in Pluto itself. Here's how it works.

## The Pipeline

The generator follows a simple pipeline:

- Read all `.txt` files from the posts directory
- Parse front matter (title, date) from each file
- Convert the body text to HTML
- Wrap each post in an HTML template with CSS
- Generate an index page listing all posts
- Write everything to the output directory

## Markdown Support

The generator handles a subset of markdown:

- Headings with `#`, `##`, and `###`
- Paragraphs separated by blank lines
- Bold text with double asterisks
- Italic text with single asterisks
- Inline code with backticks
- Unordered lists with `-` prefix

## Built with MCP Tools

The interesting part: this program was built using Pluto's MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools. An AI agent added each function and class incrementally, using `check` to validate and `run` to test along the way.
