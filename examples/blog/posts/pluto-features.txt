Let's take a deeper look at what makes Pluto interesting as a language.

## Error Handling

Pluto uses typed errors with compiler-inferred error-ability. You don't need to annotate functions — the compiler figures out which functions can fail by analyzing the call graph.

Errors propagate with the `!` operator and are caught with `catch`. It's clean and explicit without being verbose.

## Dependency Injection

The `app` declaration is Pluto's entry point. Classes declare their dependencies with bracket syntax like `class API[db: Database]`, and the compiler wires everything at compile time. No runtime container needed.

## Generics

Pluto uses monomorphization for generics — each concrete type gets its own compiled copy. This means zero runtime overhead for generic code.

These features combine to make Pluto a practical language for building real backend services.
