# The Pluto Programming Language

Welcome to The Pluto Programming Language book. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to write programs in Pluto.

## What is Pluto?

Pluto is a programming language for distributed backend systems. It compiles to native code and treats the **app** as a first-class concept -- dependency injection, error handling, and inter-service communication are built into the language, not bolted on as libraries.

```
fn main() {
    print("hello, world")
}
```

## Who is this book for?

This book assumes you have some programming experience, but not in any particular language. We'll explain Pluto's concepts from the ground up.

## How to use this book

The book is designed to be read in order. Each chapter builds on the previous one, starting with the basics and working up to Pluto's unique features like dependency injection and the app model.
